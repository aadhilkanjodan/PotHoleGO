### Project Description
PotholeGO turns the civic nightmare of potholes into a competitive mobile game. Spot potholes, upload photos, earn points, and rise through the leagues ‚Äî because road damage deserves recognition.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Roads these days? Way too smooth. Where‚Äôs the excitement? The drama? The risk of losing a tire? Worse, no one‚Äôs rewarding citizens for their elite pothole-spotting skills. We've been living in a world where potholes go unmeasured, untagged, and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî unscored. A tragedy.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We fixed it by gamifying the chaos. With PotholeGO, you can snap potholes, measure their glory, tag the GPS, and get rewarded. 10-inch pothole? +50 points. 20-inch monster? +100 points. Climb leagues, earn badges, and become the world‚Äôs top Pothole Hunter. It's like Pok√©mon Go ‚Äî but for craters.
